ByteCodeRuby
============
Version:      0.1.3
Release date: 2002-12-17
Author:       George Marrows, triptych@ntlworld.com


What is it?
-----------
A bytecode interpreter for Ruby. Standard Ruby produces a parse tree from your source code and then interprets the parse tree directly. ByteCodeRuby inserts some additional steps: it takes Ruby's parse tree and compiles it to bytecode, ie the instruction set for a virtual machine. It then interprets the bytecode. The hope is that eventually this approach will lead to improved performance for the Ruby interpreter.

It consists of a (minor) patch to Ruby 1.6.7's eval.c, ruby.h and node.h, a C extension and some Ruby code. It's currently at an experimental stage (you won't be able to run your favourite Ruby script with it), but it can nonetheless compile and run a fairly large (and increasing) subset of Ruby.


Why?
----

- to satisfy my curiosity about virtual machines and bytecode interpreters

- to (eventually) provide improved performance for Ruby, while maintaining the substantial investment in the current Ruby virtual machine.


Installation?
-------------
 1. unpack tarball (if you haven't already)

 2. compile and install Ruth
    a. cd ruth-0.8.0
    b. ruby helpers/make.rb
    c. ruby helpers/install.rb

 3. patch Ruby 1.6.7
    a. copy bytecoderuby-0.1.3/patch-1.6.7 to your Ruby 1.6.7 build area 
       (ie in the same directory as eval.c etc)
    b. cd into that directory
    c. patch -b <patch-1.6.7  
       -b ensures that the originals of altered files are backed up 
       with extension .orig
    d. make install

 4. compile and run ByteCodeRuby
    a. cd bytecoderuby-0.1.3
    b. ruby extconf.rb
    c. make
    d. ruby tests/testByteCodeRuby.rb to try it out


Example of use?
---------------
See tests/testByteCodeRuby.rb (unit tests for compilation and evaluation)


Requirements?
-------------
ByteCodeRuby uses Robert Feldt's Ruth wrapper round the standard Ruby parser, version 0.8.0. Ruth is included in the ByteCodeRuby download.

ByteCodeRuby 0.1.3 has been tested on the following set-ups:

  * Linux with Ruby 1.6.7 and gcc version 2.96 20000731

An earlier version was tested successfully on Windows 2000 Pro with Ruby 1.6.5, cygwin and gcc version 2.95.3-1

It may work on other platforms, but I can't guarantee it. I'd be very grateful
to anyone who was willing to try it on another platform and let me know the
results.


Documentation?
--------------
Very little yet. There's some fragments of information on the bytecode instruction set at the top of bytecode.rb.

Special things to note?
-----------------------
- This is currently a quick and dirty hack. I haven't yet given *any* consideration to avoiding memory leaks etc.

- There's very little in the way of checking that the bytecode you've specified is sensible. Get it wrong and your process will hang or crash.

- I'm trying to keep the bytecode interpreter as an extension for as long as possible - the code/compile/test cycle's a lot quicker that way.

- No optimisations until it all works. There are a *lot* of possible optimisations (some are listed in the Todo), but I want to resist doing any of them until the interpreter can run Ruby properly.


Plans for the future?
---------------------
See Todo.


Acknowledgements
----------------
Thanks to Matz for producing such a clean and easy to understand interpreter.

Thanks to Robert Feldt, for producing Ruth and hosting this under his RubyVM project at SourceForge.
