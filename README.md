# Bytecode Ruby

This is an early experiment I made with rewriting the Ruby virtual machine as
[bytecode interpreter](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/59486) - dates back to 2001-2003.
It was originally hosted [on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rubyvm/files/ByteCodeRuby/) and was previously on BitBucket.

The language support got a decent way along, but the project never got much traction. You should look elsewhere for Ruby interpreters!
